												<h3>GUC Open Day</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												It was my pleasure and honor to present the German University in Cairo in its Open Day 2024 for new applicants.
												I was representing the Engineering and Material Sciences (EMS) Faculty as well as the Engineering Design and Production
												Department. I had yet another opportunity to showcase the metrology lab's high-speed delta 3D printer to future GUCians with
												their respected parents. I helped shed some light on the different departments inside of EMS and what they offer based on
												the inquirers interests and goals. Being a mechatronics graduate who is now working in the Design and Production department,
												I felt confident in providing an honest and unbiased view of both departments. 
											</p>
											<p>
												This event allowed me to further enhance my presentation skills while helping guide applicants to follow their goals at the
												GUC and hopefully become an outstanding batch of future engineers.

											<p> 
												During the Engineering Production Technology course, I had the wonderful opportunity to showcase several
												popular machines and machining operations to first-year engineering students. In a collaborative effort with
												the university's workshop staff, we managed to introduce several operations on a variety of machines, including
												but not limited to:
												<ul>
													<li>Sand Casting</li>
													<li>Die Casting</li>
													<li>Milling</li>
													<li>Turning</li>
													<li>Cylindrical Grinding</li>
													<li>Sheet Metal Cutting</li>

												<h3>German President Inauguration of the German International University</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I was honoured to have participated in the official inauguration of the German International University - GIU, 
												representing the Design and Production Department at The German University in Cairo during the visit of German
												President Mr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier. His Excellency was joined by his German delegation, the Egyptian Minister 
												of Higher Education, Prof. Dr. Mohamed Ashour, GUC and GIU founder, Prof. Ashraf Mansour, The German University 
												in Cairo's president, Prof. Yasser Hegazy, and the German International University - GIU's president, Prof. Slim
												Abdennadher.
											</p>
											<p>
												During the Research and Technology Exhibition, I had the opportunity to showcase the metrology lab's high-speed
												delta 3D printer to the German President and highlighted the growth and importance of this incredible technology. 
												Additionally, we discussed some 3D printing unique capabilities, such as manufacturing jointed and flexible objects 
												in one piece, a feature that no other form of manufacturing can produce, cutting down on assembly and postprocessing 
												costs.
											<p>
												This event spotlighted the power of higher education in Egypt and fortified the strong relationship between Egypt 
												and Germany in furthering technological advancements and enlightening education.
