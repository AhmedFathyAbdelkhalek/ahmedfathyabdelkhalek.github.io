					<h1>Pneumatic Coffee <br> Bean Crusher</h1>
				</header>
				This project was part of my mechatronics lab course at the GUC. I was given this project at random by my professor with
				the aim of learning about pneumatics and integrating what we learn into a real life example that can be adopted by the
				industry. This was a solo project and it took a tremendous amount of time to build, wire, and test.

					<h2>Design</h2>
				</header>
				<span class="image left"><img src="/projects/media/pneumatic_coffee_crusher/coffee_crusher.jpg" alt="" /></span>This design was quite challenging to nail down. I wanted it to be as compact as possible while still providing
				full utility, as requested by my professor. I knew that I wanted to do the drawer concept from the very start, as I thought
				it would be interesting to hide one of the three cylinders from sight. I'm glad I stuck with that design choice because it
				looked incredible in the end. The guides for the feeding mechanism are a must, too. These ensure that when the piston is
				pushing the coffee beans, all of them will reach the crushing zone. The crushing zone works with the drawer because the
				crusher itself crushes the beans on the drawer.</p>

					<h2>Components</h2>
				</header>
				<span class="image right"><img src="/projects/media/pneumatic_coffee_crusher/crusher_electric.jpg" alt="" /></span>This project involved a lot of components. There are three pneumatic cylinders to move and crush
				the coffee, six reed switches to find the position of each piston and send a signal accordingly, three
				electrically actuated 5/2 valves to direct airflow to the appropriate cylinders,
				six L brackets to mount the pneumatic cylinders, a circuit breaker, a capacitive sensor to sense if there is coffee
				present in the feeding chamber, a massive 70x20 mm crushing head made from stainless steel, a
				steel drawer to dispense the crushed coffee, 10 relays for control, a tonne of wiring, and a 12V, 5A
				power supply unit (PSU).</p>
